    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>This is version 4.0.1 (Later 2023 Update) of my personal webpage. "Proudly" designed by me <em>(with a little help from ChatGPT)</em>, built in CotEditor 4.6.x on macOS Sonoma, and hosted on Cloudflare Pages with a Namecheap domain. <strong>Very</strong> proudly made with pure CSS and HTML, no JavaScript at all! Best reasonable balance between appearance, features, and compatibility for me.</p>
